Revision history for Perl extension PDL::NetCDF.

0.01  Thu Feb 27 13:23:19 1997
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.16

0.1   3/5/97
        - First working internal version

0.3   3/11/97
        - Now includes object oriented (read only) interface.
        - Also, imports all constants as NC_FOO and all subroutines
          as ncfoo.

0.31  3/18/97

Added new function typed_zeroes, which should be in PDL::Core.
This function does what 'zeroes' does, but allows the user to specify
the type of the PDL.  Before, I was using, for example, byte(zeroes(2,3))
which results in lots of copying.  Using typed_zeroes ([2,3], $PDL_B) is much
more efficient.

Also, I no longer export the world; I just put it in export_OK.
This means that in order to use the traditional interface, you must
use PDL::NetCDF qw (/^NC_/ /^nc/);
to get all names starting with NC_ and nc.

Lastly, the object oriented interface now includes a function to
get the size of a dimension, $dimsize = $ncobj->dimsize('dimname');


0.32  3/25/97

Fixed a nasty bug in ncvarget.  Before it had returned PDLs in class PDL::Core 
instead of class PDL.  This meant that overloaded functions did not work on 
these PDLs.  So, one could not say, for example:

$ncobj = PDL::NetCDF->new('file.nc');
$pdl1 = $ncobj->get('var1');
$pdl2 = $ncobj->get('var1');
$pdl3 = $pdl1 - $pdl2;

$pdl3 would not have what you expected.

I also fixed the single quote problem in Makefile.PL pointed out by
Christian Soeller.


0.34 9/26/97

Updated to use netcdf-3.3.1.
