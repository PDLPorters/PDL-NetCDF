- incorporate int-size patch from https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=80379 - thanks @sisyphus
- incorporate Debian patches from https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=115393
- fix not recognising https URLs, reported in https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=131169
- get method translates _FillValue to bad with PDL_BAD enabled - Heiko Klein, Norwegian Meteorological institute, from https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=67776
- allow setting of _FillValue for netcdf4 files in put/putslice command,
  since putatt does no longer work: Change of _FillValue not allowed after
  data has been written. - Heiko Klein

4.21 2021-05-01
- build and metadata updates

4.20  2013-11-18
- Added PREREQ_PM as PDL version 0 to Makefile.PL.

4.19  2013-09-16
- Fixed errors in version number to help PAUSE indexer.

4.18  2013-09-16
- Added new library path (/usr/local/lib64) and commented out PDL 2.2 requirement.
  Requested by Hernan De Angelis.

4.17  2013-03-06
- Since netcdf-4.1, the netcdf-library changes the meaning of nc_sync from
  release internal buffers to make sure everything known is written to disk.
  This slows down writing a lot. PDL::NetCDF no longer calls nc_sync
  automatically (except on close). To ensure writing the file to the disk
  while keeping it open, $nc->sync is now provided.

4.16  2012-04-07
- Since netcdf-4.20, the NC_NETCDF4 preprocessor variable can no longer be used
  to determine if HDF functionality is compiled in.  No perform a link/run
  test in Makefile.PL to determine if nc_inq_var_deflate is defined or not.
  Use this for the isNetcdf4 function as well.

4.15  2011-11-28
- Another attempt at indexing on CPAN.  Specify META_MERGE in Makefile.PL to
  set version to 4.15.

4.14  2011-08-08
- Changes by Edward Baudrez, Royal Meteorological Institute of Belgium
- added /usr/lib64 to search path for netCDF library
- PDL::NetCDF now complains correctly when trying to open a nonexistent file
  and when O_RDONLY is in effect
- PDL::NetCDF does not create a new, empty file when trying to open a
  nonexistent file and when O_RDONLY is in effect
- in test suite: sum() < $tol used to pass erroneously with large negative
  values, now checks vector norm instead of sum

4.13  2011-05-06
- Added package PDL::NetCDF to netcdf.pd (suggestion by kmx@atlas.cz)
- Fiddled with $VERSION to make it more global.  Attempts to get CPAN to index this package!

4.12  2011-05-05
- Fiddling with VERSION to try to get CPAN to index this.  Removed META.yml,
  commented out 'METAMERGE' in Makefile.PL and add 'our' to $VERSION in netcdf.pd.

4.11  2011-05-05
- Fix due to Sisyphus.  Get rid of '//' operator so it works with perl 5.8.

4.10  2011-04-21
- Improved setrec/putrec/getrec routines to allow fixed-length character
  variables to be read/written as well as numeric vectors.

4.09  2011-04-20
- Added setrec/putrec/getrec routines to quickly read/write one element
  from/to a set of 1D variables.  Requested by Robb Kambic of UNIDATA.

4.08  2011-01-31
- Patches from Heiko Klein:
- Use recursive slicing for PDL::Chars to allow high-dimensional
  string slices
- Generalize file test to allow OpenDAP to work.

4.07  2010-12-30
- Updated META.yml so CPAN (hopefully) indexes it correctly

4.06  2010-12-17
- Added patch from Sisyphus to help this to work on Windows.
  Now test $Config{'ivsize'} instead of $Config{'longsize'}
  when determining size of offset and count vectors.

4.05  2010-10-19
- Added SLOW_CHAR_FETCH option to 'new'.  This makes a get of a PDL::Char
  loop over all entries instead of doing one nc_get_var_text.  This is
  necessary if the character array contains embedded NULLs.

4.04  2010-06-15
- Changes by Heiko Klein:
- Fix bug when reading one line (slice) of string when first
  dimension is unlimited
- Enabling PDL::NetCDF to write variables without dimensions,
  e.g. projection-attribute variables in CF-1.x convention

4.03  2009-12-07
- Fixed documentation bugs

4.02  2009-08-03
- Fix bug found by Brice Lambi.  Add ability to read PDL::Char by slice when
  first dimension is unlimited.

4.01  2009-07-01
- Incorporated Changes by Heiko Klein: added netCDF 4 support

0.94  2009-03-04
- Changes contributed by Heiko Klein:  Fix bug in which the same file is closed
  and then opened again.  Updated VERSION variable to make it available programatically.

0.93  2007-07-27
- Updated test.pl to handle new message from netcdf 3.6.2 for a bogus file

0.92  2006-11-16
- Updated test.pl to skip tests requiring BAD value support on machines
  where PDL is not compiled with such support.
- Now use Test::More in test.pl.

0.90  2005-04-29
- Added fix to properly handle get of zero length variable

0.89  2004-04-21
- Added support for 64 bit little endian machines such as IBM AIX
  machines.  (Thanks to Jim Edwards).

0.87  2003-12-30
- Added the PERL_SCALAR option to allow one to fetch single valued numeric
  attributes and variables as perl scalars, not as PDLs.
- Added the PDL_BAD option to convert 'missing_value' or '_FillValue'
  numbers in a netCDF variable as PDL BADVALS.

0.84  2002-08-28
- Added PREREQ_PM for PDL version 2.2 or later to satisfy CPANPLUS email.
- Changed barfs to croaks--give error info from point of view of caller
- Fixed two bugs in getdimensionnames and gettext:  Failed to check
  existance of $self->{VARIDS}{$varnm} before making netcdf library call.

0.81  2002-05-15
- Added Environment variables NETCDF_LIBDIR and NETCDF_INCDIR which
  you can use to tell where to find netcdf.

0.78  2001-01-20
- Added read support for zero dimensional variables (variables with no dimension, just a scalar)
- Added the ability to reuse an old netCDF object for the 'new' call for similar files.
  This speeds up the reading of many similar netCDF files considerably.

0.70  1999-12-16
- Added support in 'get' and 'put' for PDL::Char type PDLs to read/write
  NetCDF character N-dimensional data as strings.
- NOW REQUIRES PDL::Char (from a recent PDL version) to work!!

0.03  1998-11-30
- changed interface:  matrix slices indexed with [1,2,3], not long([1,2,3]),
  i.e. perl array refs instead of PDLs of type long.
  This helps when on 64 bit platforms--PDL long is not necessarily
  the same size as the native long used by netCDF as indices (size_t).
- Ported to DEC alpha OSF 4.0
- Changed name to PDL::NetCDF

0.01  1997-12-31
- original version
