Revision history for Perl extension PDL::NetCDFobj

0.01  12/31/97
	- original version

0.03  11/30/98
        - changed interface:  matrix slices indexed with [1,2,3], not long([1,2,3]), 
	  i.e. perl array refs instead of PDLs of type long.

          This helps when on 64 bit platforms--PDL long is not necessarily
	  the same size as the native long used by netCDF as indices (size_t).

          Ported to DEC alpha OSF 4.0

	  Changed name to PDL::NetCDF

0.50 12/12/98

       - Changed name to 'PDL::NetCDF'.

0.60 01/05/98

       - Added support for textual NetCDF arrays.  (puttext and gettext).
