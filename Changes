Revision history for Perl extension PDL::NetCDFobj

0.01  12/31/97
	- original version

0.03  11/30/98
        - changed interface:  matrix slices indexed with [1,2,3], not long([1,2,3]), 
	  i.e. perl array refs instead of PDLs of type long.

          This helps when on 64 bit platforms--PDL long is not necessarily
	  the same size as the native long used by netCDF as indices (size_t).

          Ported to DEC alpha OSF 4.0

	  Changed name to PDL::NetCDF

0.70  12/16/99
        - Added support in 'get' and 'put' for PDL::Char type PDLs to read/write
          NetCDF character N-dimensional data as strings.  

        - NOW REQUIRES PDL::Char (from a recent PDL version) to work!!

0.78  1/20/2001
        - Added read support for zero dimensional variables (variables with no dimension, just a scalar)
        - Added the ability to reuse an old netCDF object for the 'new' call for similar files.
          This speeds up the reading of many similar netCDF files considerably.

0.81  5/15/2002
        - Added Environment variables NETCDF_LIBDIR and NETCDF_INCDIR which
          you can use to tell where to find netcdf.
0.84  8/28/2002
        - Added PREREQ_PM for PDL version 2.2 or later to satisfy CPANPLUS email.
        - Changed barfs to croaks--give error info from point of view of caller
        - Fixed two bugs in getdimensionnames and gettext:  Failed to check 
          existance of $self->{VARIDS}{$varnm} before making netcdf library call.

0.87  12/30/2003
        - Added the PERL_SCALAR option to allow one to fetch single valued numeric
          attributes and variables as perl scalars, not as PDLs.
        - Added the PDL_BAD option to convert 'missing_value' or '_FillValue' 
          numbers in a netCDF variable as PDL BADVALS.

0.89  04/21/2004
        - Added support for 64 bit little endian machines such as IBM AIX 
          machines.  (Thanks to Jim Edwards).

0.90  04/29/2005
        - Added fix to properly handle get of zero length variable

0.92  11/16/2006
        - Updated test.pl to skip tests requiring BAD value support on machines
          where PDL is not compiled with such support.
          Now use Test::More in test.pl.

0.93  07/27/2007
        - Updated test.pl to handle new message from netcdf 3.6.2 for a bogus file

0.94  03/04/2009
        - Changes contributed by Heiko Klein:  Fix bug in which the same file is closed
          and then opened again.  Updated VERSION variable to make it available programatically.


4.01  7/2009
        - Incorporated Changes by Heiko Klein: added netCDF 4 support

4.02  8/3/2009
        - Fix bug found by Brice Lambi.  Add ability to read PDL::Char by slice when
          first dimension is unlimited.
