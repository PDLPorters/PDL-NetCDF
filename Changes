Revision history for Perl extension PDL::NetCDFobj

0.01  12/31/97
	- original version

0.03  11/30/98
        - changed interface:  matrix slices indexed with [1,2,3], not long([1,2,3]), 
	  i.e. perl array refs instead of PDLs of type long.

          This helps when on 64 bit platforms--PDL long is not necessarily
	  the same size as the native long used by netCDF as indices (size_t).

          Ported to DEC alpha OSF 4.0

	  Changed name to PDL::NetCDF

0.70  12/16/99
        - Added support in 'get' and 'put' for PDL::Char type PDLs to read/write
          NetCDF character N-dimensional data as strings.  

        - NOW REQUIRES PDL::Char (from a recent PDL version) to work!!

0.78  1/20/2001
        - Added read support for zero dimensional variables (variables with no dimension, just a scalar)
        - Added the ability to reuse an old netCDF object for the 'new' call for similar files.
          This speeds up the reading of many similar netCDF files considerably.

0.81  5/15/2002
        - Added Environment variables NETCDF_LIBDIR and NETCDF_INCDIR which
          you can use to tell where to find netcdf.
0.84  8/28/2002
        - Added PREREQ_PM for PDL version 2.2 or later to satisfy CPANPLUS email.
        - Changed barfs to croaks--give error info from point of view of caller
        - Fixed two bugs in getdimensionnames and gettext:  Failed to check 
          existance of $self->{VARIDS}{$varnm} before making netcdf library call.
	- Changed 'fast' option on new() to the more general {TEMPLATE => } option.
	- Added options for compression and decompression of netCDF files to/from
	  PDLs.  Uses (mostly) standard netCDF offset/multiplier compression.
