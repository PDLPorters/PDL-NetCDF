        - Also, imports all constants as NC_FOO and all subroutines
          as ncfoo.

0.31  3/18/97

Added new function typed_zeroes, which should be in PDL::Core.
This function does what 'zeroes' does, but allows the user to specify
the type of the PDL.  Before, I was using, for example, byte(zeroes(2,3))
which results in lots of copying.  Using typed_zeroes ([2,3], $PDL_B) is much
more efficient.

Also, I no longer export the world; I just put it in export_OK.
This means that in order to use the traditional interface, you must
use PDL::NetCDF qw (/^NC_/ /^nc/);
to get all names starting with NC_ and nc.

Lastly, the object oriented interface now includes a function to
get the size of a dimension, $dimsize = $ncobj->dimsize('dimname');
