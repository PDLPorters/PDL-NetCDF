KNOWN PROBLEMS:

On Red Hat Linux 5.2, using perl 5.00404, I get the following error on the 'make':

In file included from /usr/lib/perl5/i386-linux/5.00404/CORE/perl.h:1012,
                 from NetCDF.xs:6:
/usr/lib/perl5/i386-linux/5.00404/CORE/cop.h:205: parse error before `bool'
/usr/lib/perl5/i386-linux/5.00404/CORE/cop.h:205: warning: no semicolon at end of struct or union
/usr/lib/perl5/i386-linux/5.00404/CORE/cop.h:206: warning: data definition has no type or storage class

/usr/lib/perl5/i386-linux/5.00404/CORE/cop.h:256: field `cx_subst' has incomplete type

... Lots more errors ...

I have to add the following kludge to Makefile.PL to allow it to compile:

The CCFLAGS line should be edited to look like this:

'CCFLAGS'      => '-Dbool=int -g3',  

For some reason, the 'bool' type is not set correctly in the default red hat 5.2 perl installation.

New for 0.63:

-- The above choice has now been automated for gcc/linux.  If you get errors like that above, edit 
Makefile.PL to define or not define 'bool' as appropriate.

-- There is now an attempt to automatically determine where the NetCDF library and include 
files are installed.  If this fails (perl Makefile.PL will die with a message about not finding
the lib or include file), please add the correct path to libnetcdf.so or netcdf.h on your system
to Makefile.PL (or install netCDF).
