PDL::NetCDF, version 0.30

Allows reading and writing of NetCDF files into and out of PDL objects.

The following are required for installation:

-- PDL version 1.10 or 1.11.  Will likely not work on v2.0 alphas.
   You are welcome to try, however!
-- perl 5.003 (or later)
-- NetCDF version 2.3.2, patch level 4 or later

The first two are available on CPAN.  The third is available from UCAR UNIDATA 
at 

http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/index.html

INSTALLATION:

Once the above are installed, edit the Makefile.PL to add the
lib and include paths for your machine's NetCDF installation:

On my Sun Solaris machine, these are the correct values:

$netcdf_lib_path     = '/opt/local/lib';
$netcdf_include_path = '/opt/local/include';

On many other UNIX flavors, the correct paths may be
/usr/local/*

Once this is done, do the normal perl extension thing:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test

(as root)
make install

Best of luck!
