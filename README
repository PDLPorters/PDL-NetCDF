PDL::NetCDF

Allows reading and writing of NetCDF files into and out of PDL objects using
a simple object-oriented interface.  NetCDF is a flexible, binary, portable
file standard for storing gridded data.  One can access netCDF files through
interface libraries in FORTRAN, C/C++ and perl.  Numerous utilities also exist
for manipulating these files.

See Makefile.PL for for minimum versions of Perl libraries needed,
including PDL.

NetCDF is available from UCAR UNIDATA at

http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/index.html


INSTALLATION:

Installation should be the normal:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test

(as root)
make install

For building against the NetCDF4 library with hdf5 data-support:

NETCDF_EXTRALIBS='-L/disk1/heiko/local/hdf5_1.8/lib -lhdf5_hl -lhdf5 -lz' perl Makefile.PL
make
make test

(as root)
make install

Best of luck!
