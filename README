PDL::NetCDF, version 0.71

Allows reading and writing of NetCDF files into and out of PDL objects using
a simple object-oriented interface.  NetCDF is a flexible, binary, portable
file standard for storing gridded data.  One can access netCDF files through
interface libraries in FORTRAN, C/C++ and perl.  Numerous utilities also exist
for manipulating these files.

The following are required for installation:

-- PDL v2.0.3+ (MUST have PDL::Char module to work!)

If you want to use the old version of pdl (pdl 1.11), please
use PDL::NetCDF version 0.34, also available on CPAN.  

-- perl 5.004 (or later)
-- NetCDF version 3 or later

The first two are available on CPAN.  The third is available from UCAR UNIDATA 
at
